#### Scared Stiff

David loved scary movies.The scarier,the better.He liked to feel his spine tingle.He loved to feel his hair stand on end.And sitting on the edge of his seat was his favorite way to sit.

David kept searching for the scariest movie of all.One day,he found it."The scariest time of your life!" read the sign in front of the theater."Or double your money back!"

David bought a bag of opcorn and sat down to watch teh movie.There were monsters.There were vampires.There were werewolves! David's eyes opened wide. The sign was right.This was the scariest movie he had ever seen.

David reached for the popcorn.But his hand would not move. He tried to look down but he could not move his eyes."What is wrong with me?" David wondered.Then he understood.He was scared stiff.

Later,the movie theater was about to closer for the night. David still sat quietly in his seat.He was the only customer left. The theater manager came up to David.

"I'm sorry.sir," the manager said,"the theater is closing for the night.You'll have to leave now."David iddn't move.He COULDN"T move.He was scared stiff!

"Hmm," the manager said,"I think we'd better call the police."

Soon the police arrived.They shined a flashlight in David's eyes.Still David didn't move."We'd better call for an ambulance," one policeman said.

Moments later,the paramedics came up to David. One of them waved a hand in front of David's face."I would move if I could," David thought."But I can't! I'm scared stiff!"
