#### The Very Big Carrot

One day,Six rabbits found a very vig carrot."Wow! What a very big carrot!" they said to each other.

They dug up the very big carrot and tried to think of the very best way to use it.

What could they do with the very big carrot? May be they could make it into a boat ...... and say hello to all the fishes!

What else could they do with the very big carrot? Maybe they could make it into an airplane ...... and fly away to far-off lands!

What else could they do with the very big carrot? Maybe they cold make it into a garden high up in the sky ...... and it would be the most beautiful garden ever!

What else could they do with the very big carrot? Maybe they could make it into a house ...... and it would be the biggest house in the whole world!

Dreaming up so many things to do with the carrot made all the rabbits very hungry.

But then they thought of one more thing they could do with the very big carrot ...... They could EAT the very big carrot!
