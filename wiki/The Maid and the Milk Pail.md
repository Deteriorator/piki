One day a milkmaid was walking to market. She was on her way to sell some fresh milk.

The milk was in a silver pail. The maid had learned to carry  the pail by balancing it on her head.

As she walked,the maid began thinking about what she would do with the money she would get for the milk.

"I'll buy some chickens from Farmer Brown," she said, "and they will lay eggs each morning. When those eggs hatch, I'll have even more chickens. I'll have more eggs,too!"

"Soon I will have enough money to buy the blue dress I've wanted," the milkmaid thought some more,"and some blue ribbon to match. Oh,I'll look so lovely!"

"In fact," the maid thought to herself,"I'll look so lovely that all the boys will want to dance with me at the fair. All the girls will be jealous. But I won't care--I'll just toss my head at them...like this!"

The milkmaid tossed back her head. Withe that,the pail flew off,and the milk spilled all over the road!

The milkmaid had to return home and tell her parents what had happened.

"My child." said her mother,"never count your chickens before they've hatched."

In other words,don't make plans based on things that haven't happened yet!
