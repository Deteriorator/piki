When I was six years old my dad was teaching me how to play Dungeons and Dragons. Intelligence and Wisdom are separate stats in D&D. I found that so strange. So I asked him :

"Daddy, why are Intelligence and Wisdom different?"    
"Because you can be a brilliant medical doctor who smokes cigarettes."

Intelligence is your ability to understand and learn concepts and information. Wisdom, or what you're calling common sense, is your experiences, your intuition, your habits, and how you apply them in your life.
